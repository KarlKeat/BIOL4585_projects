# Data summary by Karl Keat

## Overview of data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.168233/FE_datfile_TTolerance.csv which describes the heat tolerance of different crustaceans.

## Q1: Does sex correlate with heat tolerance?

*Interpretation*: At first glance, the data appears to imply that female crustaceans have a higher overall heat tolerance than male ones. However, when you facet the data by species, a different trend emerges.

Within species, there does not appear to be significant variation between genders in heat tolerance. Furthermore, it appears that for some species, there is a significant skew towards one gender in the observed population. This means that the variation in heat tolerance is probably a result of variation between the species.

## Q2: Does heat tolerance vary with oxygen level?

*Interpretation*: The data show that ... blah blah blah.

## Q3: Does water habitat type affect heat tolerance?

*Interpretation*: The data show that ... blah blah blah.
